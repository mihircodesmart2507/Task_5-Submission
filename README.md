# Overview: 
This project focuses on analyzing Netflix’s dataset to uncover insights about content trends, ratings, genres, and release patterns.
The goal is to transform raw Netflix data into visual stories using Python and its data analysis libraries.

The notebook (Netflix Data Analysis.ipynb) performs data cleaning, exploration, and visualization to answer key business and entertainment questions. 

# Objectives: 

Analyze the distribution of movies and TV shows on Netflix.
Identify top genres, most frequent countries, and release year trends.
Explore content ratings and their target audience.
Study the evolution of Netflix content over time.
Derive actionable insights using data visualization and summary statistics.   

# Dataset Information:
